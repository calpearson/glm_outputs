# glm_outputs
Functions that allow you to present your glm outputs in a easy to understand format

As the above states this is where i am dumpting all the functions that i have created that have anything to do with a glm output.
Whether it be turn a output into a explanation of the output or a faster way to display the a exponentiated model
